# SAS
Some practice examples I learned from a online SAS class in Udemy (from zero basic)


Three different styles of input that are available to us in SAS:
1. Column input: allows you to read data values that are entered in fixed columns.
2. List input: allows you to read the data by simply listing the variable names in the INPUT statement. At least one space (or character) must occur between each value in the data set.
3. Formatted input: allows you to read numeric data containing special characters, such as dates and dollar amounts.




class1:
1. use DATALINES statement to read instream data.
2. use INFILE statement to read the data from a raw data file (in .dat or .txt format).
3. use SET statement to read the data from another SAS data set.
4. use INPUT statement with propoer column numbers to read data arranged in well defined columns.
5. use two-level name in the DATA statement for creating permanent SAS data set.
6. use one-level name in the DATA statement for creating temporary SAS data set.
