# SAS
Some practice examples I learned from online SAS class (from zero basic)


Three different styles of input that are available to us in SAS:
1. Column input: allows you to read data values that are entered in fixed columns.
2. List input: allows you to read the data by simply listing the variable names in the INPUT statement. At least one space (or character) must occur between each value in the data set.
3. Formatted input: allows you to read numeric data containing special characters, such as dates and dollar amounts.
